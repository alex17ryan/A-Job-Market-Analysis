# Huh?

So... I just wrapped up my degree 🎓 and I am starting a new job hunt. To get a feel for what’s hot (or not) in the Algerian dev job market, I did some good ol’ web-scraping ;) and dug through job posts like a raccoon. 🦝

And unlike some of you selfish-ass mfs who never share shit, I actually decided to post my findings here.

# Quick Peek

I analyzed over 100 job posts from May 2025, all aimed at Algerian developers. Then counted how often different techs showed up and made some nice lil’ charts:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./assets/1.png"/></td>
    <td><img src="./assets/2.png"/></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./assets/3.png"/></td>
    <td><img src="./assets/4.png"/></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./assets/5.png"/></td>
    <td><img src="./assets/6.png"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./assets/7.png" style="width: 100%;"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>
